### Hi guys ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ezequias Kluyvert and I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).
I am a Systems Development technician from the Technical College of UFMG - COLTEC, and I am currently part of a project called [Enxurrada Enxurrada](http://www.enxurradadebits.cefetmg.br/), in which I am very proud to participate. Also, I'm always looking for new ways to teach and learn technology.

Would you like to find me?
